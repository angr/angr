class ForwardAnalysis:
    """
    This is my very first attempt to build a static forward analysis framework that can serve as the base of multiple
    static analyses in angr, including CFG analysis, VFG analysis, DDG, etc.

    In short, ForwardAnalysis performs a forward data-flow analysis by traversing a graph, compute on abstract values,
    and store results in abstract states. The user can specify what graph to traverse, how a graph should be traversed,
    how abstract values and abstract states are defined, etc.

    ForwardAnalysis has a few options to toggle, making it suitable to be the base class of several different styles of
    forward data-flow analysis implementations.

    ForwardAnalysis supports a special mode when no graph is available for traversal (for example, when a CFG is being
    initialized and constructed, no other graph can be used). In that case, the graph traversal functionality is
    disabled, and the optimal graph traversal order is not guaranteed. The user can provide a job sorting method to
    sort the jobs in queue and optimize traversal order.

    Feel free to discuss with me (Fish) if you have any suggestions or complaints.
