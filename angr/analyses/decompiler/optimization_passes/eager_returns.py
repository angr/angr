    Some compilers (if not all) generate only one returning block for a function regardless of how many returns there
    are in the source code. This oftentimes result in irreducible graphs and reduce the readability of the decompiled
    code. This optimization pass will make the function return eagerly by duplicating the return site of a function
    multiple times and assigning one copy of the return site to each of its sources when certain thresholds are met.

    Note that this simplifier may reduce the readability of the generated code in certain cases, especially if the graph
    is already reducible without applying this simplifier.

    :ivar int max_level:    Number of times that we repeat the process of making returns eager.
    :ivar int min_indegree: The minimum in-degree of the return site to be duplicated.
    :ivar node_idx:         The next node index. Each duplicated return site gets assigned a unique index, otherwise
                            those duplicates will be considered as the same block in the graph because they have the
                            same hash.
