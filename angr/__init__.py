=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  WELCOME TO THE FUTURE!  =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

angr has transitioned to python 3. Due to the small size of the team behind it,
we can't reasonably maintain compatibility between both python 2 and python 3.
If you want to continue using the most recent version of angr (you definitely
want that, trust us) you should upgrade to python 3. It's like getting your
vaccinations. It hurts a little bit initially but in the end it's worth it.

For more information, see here: https://docs.angr.io/appendix/migration

Good luck!
