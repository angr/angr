        If you would like to directly work with a `SimSuccessors` object, you can obtain it with
        ``simgr.successors(state, **kwargs)``. This is not recommended, as it denies other hooks the opportunity to
        look at the successors. Therefore, the usual technique is to call ``simgr.step_state(state, **kwargs)`` and
        then mutate the returned dict before returning it yourself.

        ..note:: This takes precedence over the `filter` hook - `filter` is only applied to states returned from here
        in the None stash.

        other hooks the opportunity to instrument the step. Instead, you can mutate the kwargs for the step before
        calling the original, and mutate the result before returning it yourself.

        You should *not* call ``simgr.complete``, you should make your own decision and return True or False.
