    Search for up to "num_find" paths that satisfy condition "find", avoiding condition "avoid". Stashes found paths into "find_stash' and avoided paths into "avoid_stash".

    The "find" and "avoid" parameters may be any of:

    - An address to find
    - A set or list of addresses to find
    - A function that takes a path and returns whether or not it matches.

    If an angr CFG is passed in as the "cfg" parameter and "find" is either a number or a list or a set, then
    any paths which cannot possibly reach a success state without going through a failure state will be
    preemptively avoided.

    If either the "find" or "avoid" parameter is a function returning a boolean, and a path triggers both conditions, it will be added to the find stash, unless "avoid_priority" is set to True.
