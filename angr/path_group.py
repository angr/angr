class PathGroup(ana.Storable):
    """
    Path groups are the future.

    Path groups allow you to wrangle multiple paths in a slick way. Paths are organized into "stashes", which you can
    step forward, filter, merge, and move around as you wish. This allows you to, for example, step two different
    stashes of paths at different rates, then merge them together.

    Stashes can be accessed as attributes (i.e. pg.active). A mulpyplexed stash can be retrieved by prepending the name
    with `mp_` (e.g., `pg.mp_active`).

    Note that you shouldn't usually be constructing path groups directly - there is a convenient shortcuts for
    creating path groups in ``Project.factory``: see :class:`angr.factory.AngrObjectFactory`.

    Multithreading your search can be useful in constraint-solving-intensive paths. Indeed, Python cannot multithread
    due to its GIL, but z3, written in C, can.

    The most important methods you should look at are ``step``, ``explore``, and ``use_tech``.
