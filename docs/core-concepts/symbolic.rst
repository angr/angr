Symbolic Execution
==================


Symbolic execution is a program analysis technique used to explore multiple
execution paths of a program simultaneously. Unlike normal execution, which
runs the program with specific inputs, symbolic execution treats inputs as
symbolic variables rather than concrete values. This means the execution
can represent a wide range of inputs with symbolic expressions. Symbolic
execution allows, at a time in emulation, to determine for a branch all
conditions necessary to take a branch or not. Every variable is represented
as a symbolic value, and each branch as a constraint. Thus, symbolic execution
allows us to see which conditions allow the program to go from point A to
point B by resolving these constraints. The execution paths are then analyzed
by solving constraints generated by these symbolic expressions, allowing the
discovery of bugs and vulnerabilities that might be missed in standard testing.


Example:
--------

Consider the following simple program :

.. code-block:: c

    const char* check_value(int x) {
        if (x > 10) {
            return "Greater";
        } else {
            return "Lesser or Equal";
        }
    }

In normal execution, if ``x`` is set to 5, the program will follow the path
where ``x <= 10`` and return "Lesser or Equal". In symbolic execution, ``x``
is treated as a symbolic variable, ``X``. The execution engine explores both
paths:

   - Path 1: ``X > 10`` leading to the result "Greater"
   - Path 2: ``X <= 10`` leading to the result "Lesser or Equal"

Constraints for both paths are generated and solved to understand all possible
behaviors of the program.




In software verification, it helps ensure that the code behaves as expected
across all possible inputs and states. For security analysis, symbolic execution
can uncover vulnerabilities such as input validation errors, which could be
exploited by attackers. Additionally, in automated testing, it aids in
generating comprehensive test cases that cover edge cases and rare execution
paths, enhancing the robustness and security of software systems. Overall,
symbolic execution provides a powerful means to rigorously analyze and improve
software and firmware reliability.

Basic Execution
---------------
Now let's see an example use case of symbolic execution with angr. Consider the following example code,


.. code-block:: c

    void helloWorld() {
        printf("Hello, World!\n");
    }


    void firstCall(uint32_t num) {
        if (num > 50 && num <100)
            HelloWorld();
    }


The ``firstCall`` function will accept a 32-bit number as an input and will call
``helloWorld`` function if the number is between 50 and 100.

You can perform a symbolic execution to find a correct and valid input to reach
the final ``helloWorld`` function call with angr using the following sample code.


.. code-block:: python

    import angr, claripy
    # Load the binary
    project = angr.Project('./3func', auto_load_libs=False)

    # Define the address of the firstCall function
    firstCall_addr = project.loader.main_object.get_symbol("firstCall")

    # Define the address of the helloWorld function
    helloWorld_addr = project.loader.main_object.get_symbol("helloWorld")
    # Create a symbolic variable for the firstCall arg
    input_arg = claripy.BVS('input_arg', 32)

    # Create a blank state at the address of the firstCall function
    init_state = project.factory.blank_state(addr=firstCall_addr.rebased_addr)

    # Assuming the calling convention passes the argument in a register
    # (e.g., x86 uses edi for the argument)
    init_state.regs.edi = input_arg

    # Create a simulation manager
    simgr = project.factory.simulation_manager(init_state)

    # Explore the binary, looking for the address of helloWorld
    simgr.explore(find=helloWorld_addr.rebased_addr)

    # Check if we found a state that reached the target
    if simgr.found:
        input_value = simgr.found[0].solver.eval(input_arg)
        print(f"Value of input_arg that reaches HelloWorld: {input_value}")
    else:
        print("Did not find a state that reaches HelloWorld.")


It will produce the output like below with a valid arg that can reach the
function ``helloWorld``.

.. code-block:: shell
   Value of input_arg that reaches HelloWorld: 71
