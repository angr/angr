Help Wanted
===========

.. todo::
   This page is woefully out of date. We need to update it.

angr is a huge project, and it's hard to keep up. Here, we list some big TODO
items that we would love community contributions for in the hope that it can
direct community involvement. They (will) have a wide range of complexity, and
there should be something for all skill levels!

We tag issues on our github repositories that would be good for community
involvement as "Help wanted". To see the exhaustive list of these, use `this
github search!
<https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=user%3Aangr+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=Issues&ref=advsearch&l=&l=>`_

Documentation
-------------

There are many parts of angr that suffer from little or no documentation. We
desperately need community help in this area.

API
^^^

We are always behind on documentation. We've created several tracking issues on
github to understand what's still missing:


#. `angr <https://github.com/angr/angr/issues/145>`_
#. `claripy <https://github.com/angr/claripy/issues/17>`_
#. `cle <https://github.com/angr/cle/issues/29>`_
#. `pyvex <https://github.com/angr/pyvex/issues/34>`_

GitBook
^^^^^^^

This book is missing some core areas. Specifically, the following could be
improved:


#. Finish some of the TODOs floating around the book.
#. Organize the Examples page in some way that makes sense. Right now, most of
   the examples are very redundant. It might be cool to have a simple table of
   most of them so that the page is not so overwhelming.

angr course
^^^^^^^^^^^

Developing a "course" of sorts to get people started with angr would be really
beneficial. Steps have already been made in this direction `here
<https://github.com/angr/angr-doc/pull/74>`_, but more expansion would be
beneficial.

Ideally, the course would have a hands-on component, of increasing difficulty,
that would require people to use more and more of angr's capabilities.

Research re-implementation
--------------------------

Unfortunately, not everyone bases their research on angr ;-). Until that's
remedied, we'll need to periodically implement related work, on top of angr, to
make it reusable within the scope of the framework. This section lists some of
this related work that's ripe for reimplementation in angr.

Redundant State Detection for Dynamic Symbolic Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Bugrara, et al. describe a method to identify and trim redundant states,
increasing the speed of symbolic execution by up to 50 times and coverage by 4%.
This would be great to have in angr, as an ExplorationTechnique. The paper is
here: `http://nsl.cs.columbia.edu/projects/minestrone/papers/atc13-bugrara.pdf
<http://nsl.cs.columbia.edu/projects/minestrone/papers/atc13-bugrara.pdf>`_

In-Vivo Multi-Path Analysis of Software Systems
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rather than developing symbolic summaries for every system call, we can use a
technique proposed by `S2E <http://dslab.epfl.ch/pubs/s2e.pdf>`_ for
concretizing necessary data and dispatching them to the OS itself. This would
make angr applicable to a *much* larger set of binaries than it can currently
analyze.

While this would be most useful for system calls, once it is implemented, it
could be trivially applied to any location of code (i.e., library functions). By
carefully choosing which library functions are handled like this, we can greatly
increase angr's scalability.

Development
-----------

We have several projects in mind that primarily require development effort.

angr-management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The angr GUI, `angr-management <https://github.com/angr/angr-management>`_ needs
a *lot* of work. Here is a non-exhaustive list of what is currently missing in
angr-management:


* A navigator toolbar showing content in a program's memory space, just like IDA
  Pro's navigator toolbar.
* A text-based disassembly view of the program.
* Better view showing details in program states during path exploration,
  including modifiable register view, memory view, file descriptor view, etc.
* A GUI for cross referencing.

Exposing angr's capabilities in a usable way, graphically, would be really useful!

IDA Plugins
^^^^^^^^^^^

Much of angr's functionality could be exposed via IDA. For example, angr's data
dependence graph could be exposed in IDA through annotations, or obfuscated
values can be resolved using symbolic execution.

Additional architectures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

More architecture support would make angr all the more useful.
Supporting a new architecture with angr would involve:


#. Adding the architecture information to `archinfo
   <https://github.com/angr/archinfo>`_
#. Adding an IR translation. This may be either an extension to PyVEX, producing
   IRSBs, or another IR entirely.
#. If your IR is not VEX, add a ``SimEngine`` to support it.
#. Adding a calling convention (``angr.SimCC``) to support SimProcedures
   (including system calls)
#. Adding or modifying an ``angr.SimOS`` to support initialization activities.
#. Creating a CLE backend to load binaries, or extending the CLE ELF backend to
   know about the new architecture if the binary format is ELF.

**ideas for new architectures:**


* PIC, AVR, other embedded architectures
* SPARC (there is some preliminary libVEX support for SPARC `here
  <https://bitbucket.org/iraisr/valgrind-solaris>`_)

**ideas for new IRs:**


* LLVM IR (with this, we can extend angr from just a Binary Analysis Framework
  to a Program Analysis Framework and expand its capabilities in other ways!)
* SOOT (there is no reason that angr can't analyze Java code, although doing so
  would require some extensions to our memory model)

Environment support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We use the concept of "function summaries" in angr to model the environment of
operating systems (i.e., the effects of their system calls) and library
functions. Extending this would be greatly helpful in increasing angr's utility.
These function summaries can be found `here
<https://github.com/angr/angr/tree/master/angr/procedures>`_.

A specific subset of this is system calls. Even more than library function
SimProcedures (without which angr can always execute the actual function), we
have very few workarounds for missing system calls. Every implemented system
call extends the set of binaries that angr can handle.

Design Problems
---------------

There are some outstanding design challenges regarding the integration of
additional functionalities into angr.

Type annotation and type information usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

angr has fledgling support for types, in the sense that it can parse them out of
header files. However, those types are not well exposed to do anything useful
with. Improving this support would make it possible to, for example, annotate
certain memory regions with certain type information and interact with them
intelligently. Consider, for example, interacting with a linked list like this:
``print state.mem[state.regs.rax].llist.next.next.value``.

(editor's note: you can actually already do this)

Research Challenges
-------------------

Historically, angr has progressed in the course of research into novel areas of
program analysis. Here, we list several self-contained research projects that
can be tackled.

Semantic function identification/diffing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Current function diffing techniques (TODO: some examples) have drawbacks. For
the CGC, we created a semantic-based binary identification engine (
`https://github.com/angr/identifier <https://github.com/angr/identifier>`_)
that can identify functions based on testcases. There are two areas of
improvement, each of which is its own research project:


#. Currently, the testcases used by this component are human-generated. However,
   symbolic execution can be used to automatically generate testcases that can
   be used to recognize instances of a given function in other binaries.
#. By creating testcases that achieve a "high-enough" code coverage of a given
   function, we can detect changes in functionality by applying the set of
   testcases to another implementation of the same function and analyzing
   changes in code coverage. This can then be used as a sematic function diff.

Applying AFL's path selection criteria to symbolic execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AFL does an excellent job in identifying "unique" paths during fuzzing by
tracking the control flow transitions taken by every path. This same metric can
be applied to symbolic exploration, and would probably do a depressingly good
job, considering how simple it is.

Overarching Research Directions
-------------------------------

There are areas of program analysis that are not well explored. We list general
directions of research here, but readers should keep in mind that these
directions likely describe potential undertakings of entire PhD dissertations.

Process interactions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Almost all work in the field of binary analysis deals with single binaries, but
this is often unrealistic in the real world. For example, the type of input that
can be passed to a CGI program depend on pre-processing by a web server.
Currently, there is no way to support the analysis of multiple concurrent
processes in angr, and many open questions in the field (i.e., how to model
concurrent actions).

Intra-process concurrency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Similar to the modeling of interactions between processes, little work has been
done in understanding the interaction of concurrent threads in the same process.
Currently, angr has no way to reason about this, and it is unclear from the
theoretical perspective how to approach this.

A subset of this problem is the analysis of signal handlers (or hardware
interrupts). Each signal handler can be modeled as a thread that can be executed
at any time that a signal can be triggered. Understanding when it is meaningful
to analyze these handlers is an open problem. One system that does reason about
the effect of interrupts is `FIE <http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~davidson/fie/>`_.

Path explosion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many approaches (such as `Veritesting
<https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~dbrumley/pdf/Avgerinos et al._2014_Enhancing
Symbolic Execution with Veritesting.pdf>`_) attempt to mitigate the path
explosion problem in symbolic execution. However, despite these efforts, path
explosion is still *the* main problem preventing symbolic execution from being
mainstream.

angr provides an excellent base to implement new techniques to control path
explosion. Most approaches can be easily implemented as
:py:class:`~angr.exploration_techniques.ExplorationTechnique` s and quickly
evaluated (for example, on the `CGC dataset
<https://github.com/CyberGrandChallenge/samples>`_).
