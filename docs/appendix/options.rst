List of State Options
=====================

State Modes
~~~~~~~~~~~

These may be enabled by passing ``mode=xxx`` to a state constructor.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Mode name
     - Description
   * - ``symbolic``
     - The default mode. Useful for most emulation and analysis tasks.
   * - ``symbolic_approximating``
     - Symbolic mode, but enables approximations for constraint solving.
   * - ``static``
     - A preset useful for static analysis. The memory model becomes an abstract
       region-mapping system, "fake return" successors skipping calls are added,
       and more.
   * - ``fastpath``
     - A preset for extremely lightweight static analysis. Executing will skip
       all intensive processing to give a quick view of the behavior of code.
   * - ``tracing``
     - A preset for attempting to execute concretely through a program with a
       given input. Enables unicorn, enables resilience options, and will
       attempt to emulate access violations correctly.


Option Sets
~~~~~~~~~~~

These are sets of options, found as ``angr.options.xxx``.

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Set name
     - Description
   * - ``common_options``
     - Options necessary for basic execution
   * - ``symbolic``
     - Options necessary for basic symbolic execution
   * - ``resilience``
     - Options that harden angr's emulation against unsupported operations,
       attempting to carry on by treating the result as an unconstrained
       symbolic value and logging the occasion to ``state.history.events``.
   * - ``refs``
     - Options that cause angr to keep a log of all the memory, register, and
       temporary references complete with dependency information in
       ``history.actions``. This option consumes a lot of memory, so be careful!
   * - ``approximation``
     - Options that enable approximations of constraint solves via value-set
       analysis instead of calling into z3
   * - ``simplification``
     - Options that cause data to be run through z3's simplifiers before it
       reaches memory or register storage
   * - ``unicorn``
     - Options that enable the unicorn engine for executing on concrete data
